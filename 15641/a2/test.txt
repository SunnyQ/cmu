We test this program on three different andrew machines.
1. Fetch the object on different node. (Object saved locally or on another node)
2. Add file and then fetch it on on another node.
3. Close one routing daemon, and fetch the objects on it again.
4. Restart the previously closed routing daemon and test above operations.
4. Fetch things with longest prefix function.
